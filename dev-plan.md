## ðŸ”§ TibaneC2 Development Roadmap

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 1 â€“ Core C2 Server (C/C++)

use JSON for data

**Goal:** Establish a multithreaded TCP server that can handle multiple implants and basic tasking.

**Milestones:**

* [] TCP socket listener (multi-client)
* [ ] Identify and register agents (ID, OS, IP)
* [ ] Command queue per agent
* [ ] Task dispatch and response handling
* [ ] Logging to stdout and/or file
* [ ] MySQL database integration
* [ ] Protocol: JSON or custom binary
* [ ] AES encryption (optional, phase 3)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 2 â€“ Basic Implant (C/C++)

**Goal:** A persistent client that connects, receives a command, executes it, and sends back the result.

**Milestones:**

* [ ] Implant connects to server and registers itself
* [ ] Polling loop for new tasks
* [ ] Shell command execution (e.g., `whoami`, `ls`)
* [ ] Send command output back to server
* [ ] Lightweight, stealthy design
* [ ] Add reconnect on failure

---

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 3 â€“ CLI Console (C)

**Goal:** Build an interactive terminal interface to manage agents and send tasks.

**Milestones:**

* [ ] Connect to core server via socket
* [ ] List active agents
* [ ] Select agent, send command
* [ ] View responses
* [ ] Basic curses UI (optional)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 4 â€“ Web Panel (PHP)

**Goal:** Provide a web interface for viewing and controlling implants via the core server.

**Milestones:**

* [ ] Agent dashboard (list, info, last seen)
* [ ] Command form (per-agent)
* [ ] Result viewer
* [ ] PHP-to-C communication (via socket, pipe, or REST wrapper)
* [ ] User login system (basic auth)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 5 â€“ Database Integration (SQLite/PostgreSQL)

**Goal:** Store all agents, tasks, results, and logs.

**Milestones:**

* [ ] Schema: agents, tasks, logs, results
* [ ] Insert/query/update from core server
* [ ] Log failed connections, task errors, operator actions
* [ ] Query logs via CLI/PHP

---

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 6 â€“ Stagers / Loaders

**Goal:** Build short payloads that download and execute implants.

**Milestones:**

* [ ] PowerShell one-liner
* [ ] Bash downloader
* [ ] Python stager
* [ ] C executable dropper
* [ ] x86 ASM shellcode stager (stage 0)
* [ ] Encrypted implant payloads (AES-CTR or XOR)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 7 â€“ Automation Tools

**Goal:** Automate generation, deployment, and monitoring.

**Milestones:**

* [ ] `payload_generator.py` â€” generates obfuscated and staged payloads
* [ ] `health_check.sh` â€” monitors server and DB health
* [ ] `emulator.py` â€” simulates fake agent activity
* [ ] `task_runner.py` â€” bulk command dispatcher

---

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 8 â€“ Advanced Implant Capabilities

**Goal:** Make implants more flexible and dangerous.

**Milestones:**

* [ ] File upload/download
* [ ] Screenshot capture (Windows/Linux)
* [ ] Keylogger (Windows: WinAPI, Linux: X11)
* [ ] Persistence (registry, cron)
* [ ] Sleep + jitter settings
* [ ] Kill switch

---

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 9 â€“ OPSEC and Stealth Features

**Goal:** Improve real-world usability and evasion.

**Milestones:**

* [ ] TLS support
* [ ] HTTP/S fallback mode
* [ ] SNI/Host header mimicry
* [ ] User-Agent rotation
* [ ] Basic sandbox detection (CPU cores, disk size, uptime)

---

### ðŸ”¹ Phase 10 â€“ Extensions and Plugins

**Goal:** Enable modular features and scale.

**Milestones:**

* [ ] Plugin loading system for implants (task handlers)
* [ ] Plugin management via CLI/web
* [ ] SOCKS proxy module
* [ ] Encrypted file-based dead-drop C2 (optional)

---

## Optional 

* [ ] Create a Docker lab for testing
* [ ] Write documentation for operator usage
* [ ] Create training emulation scenarios
* [ ] Port implant to Windows (Win32 API) and Linux (POSIX)
